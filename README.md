# Project Overview

Hiring Management Web App is a web-based application designed to help companies manage the recruitment process efficiently — from creating job openings, receiving candidate applications, to tracking the recruitment status of each position.

This application is built with modern technologies using React, TypeScript, and Supabase as a backend-as-a-service, making it easier to handle authentication, data storage, and real-time integrations.

## Built with

- React Typescript Vite
- React Router V7 (Declarative mode)
